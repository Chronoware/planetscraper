Planet Scraper file specification, v0.1 (0001)


0. Main assumptions
  1. World map
    1. Coordinate system
  	  X - horizontal from west to east
      Y - horizontal from north to south
	  Z - vertical from down to up
	2. World boundaries
	  World map is looping in X and Y axes, but not in Z axis. Maximum
	  coordinate value is 4095 (0xFFF) for X and Y, and 255 for Z.

1. HEADER (64B)
  1. File signature (4B, always "SCRP")
  2. File version (4B, hex from 0000 to FFFF)
  3. World name (32B)
  4. Seed (8B, hex)
  5. Reserved (16B)
  
2. MAP
  1. Generated chunks
    1. End of chunks info in bytes from the begining of the file + 1 (4B)
	2. Chunks info (max 256*256=65536)
	  1. Coordinates of the chunk (2B, X and Y)
	  2. List of blocks
		1. Number of continous blocks (0-3B, in XYZ order)
		  Bytes in that part always start with first bit equal to 1. Number of
		  that bytes must be in range <0;3> It's decoded using the following
		  pattern: set first bit to 0 and save it as N, where N is number of
		  continous blocks. As long as next byte's first bit is 1, shift N
		  leftwards by 7 bits and OR N with that byte. If next byte's first
		  bit is equal to 0, end decoding
		2. ID of block (1B)
		  ID is always in range <0;127>, because first bit must be 0.
  2. Objects
	1. End of objects info in bytes from the begining of the file + 1 (4B)
	2. Objects info
	  1. Coordinates of the object (5B)
		1. X coordinate (2B, first 4 bits equal to 0, see 0.1.2)
		2. Y coordinate (2B, same as above)
		3. Z coordinate (1B)
	  2. Type of object (2B, where 1st byte is category and 2nd one is subtype)
	  3. Size of remaining object data in bytes
